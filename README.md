# C Language Programs

This repository contains a collection of programs written in the C programming language. These programs cover a variety of topics, including call by value, call by reference, recursion, extern class, static variables, pointers to arrays, pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, structures, unions, and graphics.

## Introduction
C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level programming capabilities. The programs in this repository aim to provide examples and practice exercises for various concepts in C programming.

## Getting Started
To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Install a C compiler such as Turbo c++ or Dev C++ on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the C programs using the C compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable files to see the program output.

## Program List
The repository currently includes the following programs:

1. [Call by Value](p1_call_by_value.c): Demonstrates the concept of call by value in function arguments.
2. [Call by Reference](p2_call_by_reference.c): Illustrates the concept of call by reference using pointers.
3. [Recursion](p3_recursion.c): Implements recursive functions to solve various problems.
4. [Extern Class](p4_extern_class.c): Shows the usage of the `extern` keyword to declare variables across multiple files.
5. [Static Variable](p5_static_variable.c): Demonstrates the usage of static variables within functions and their behavior.
6. [Pointer to array](p6_ pointer_to_array.c): Explains the concept of a pointer to an array.
7. [Pointer to Function](p7_pointer_to_function.c): Demonstrates the usage of pointers to functions.
8. [Pointer to Pointer](p8_pointer_to_pointer.c): Illustrates the concept of pointers to pointers in C.
9. [Structure](p9_Structure.c): Defines and uses structures in C.
10. [Graphics](p10_graphics.c): Introduces basic graphics programming in C using the `graphics.h` library.
11. [Union](p11_union.c): Explains the concept of a union and its applications.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with these programs to enhance your understanding of C programming concepts.
